## 🎯 What is Sphinx?

Sphinx is a **cutting-edge autonomous cloud engineering platform** built entirely for the terminal. It combines **AI-powered infrastructure optimization** with **real-time observability** to transform cloud management from reactive operations into an autonomous, predictive discipline.

### ⚡ Key Highlights

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Optimization** - Gemini-driven IaC generation and intelligent cost optimization
- 📊 **Integrated Observability** - Real-time metrics monitoring with Prometheus integration
- 🔄 **Closed-Loop Automation** - From detection to action within a single interface
- 🎨 **Rich Terminal UI** - Sophisticated TUI built with Textual framework
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible analysis engine with custom rules
- 🏗️ **Clean Architecture** - Hexagonal design with ports and adapters pattern
- ⚡ **Async-First Design** - Non-blocking operations with asyncio throughout
- 📦 **Ready-to-Deploy** - Docker Compose setup with Prometheus included

### 🏆 What Makes It Special?

```
✅ Generative AI for IaC code creation
✅ Anomaly detection with custom rules
✅ Terraform plan/apply orchestration
✅ SQLite-based action history
✅ Plugin system for extensibility
✅ Multi-workspace management
```
